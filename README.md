### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Front-end Developer with a life-long hobby of dance games, currently focused on [StepManiaX](https://stepmaniax.com/).

I work at [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/) and have touched most of the core features on the site over the past 10+ years.

I maintain [DDR.tools](https://ddr.tools/) which is used by many dance game tournaments for randomized song picks. Most of
my open source work is focused on this or on related efforts.
